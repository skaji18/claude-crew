# Maximum number of parallel sub-agents
max_parallel: 10

# Maximum retry count when result files are missing
max_retries: 2

# Minimum tasks to enable background execution

# Maximum turns (API round-trips) per sub-agent (maps to Task tool max_turns)

# Maximum cmd execution duration (seconds). Warning logged if exceeded.
# Optional: set to null to disable time tracking.

# Retrospect mechanism (Phase 4)
# Post-mortem & success analysis after cmd completion
retrospect:
  enabled: true                  # false to skip Phase 4 entirely

  model: sonnet                  # Model for retrospector (sonnet recommended for analysis)
  full_mode:
    max_improvements: 2          # Max improvement proposals (from failure patterns)

  light_mode:

  memory:
    max_candidates_per_cmd: 5    # Max Memory MCP candidates per cmd (aggregator enforces)
    skill_min_score: 12          # Minimum 3-axis score for skill proposals (max=15)

# Learned Preferences (LP) System
# Learns user preferences from interaction patterns to reduce translation cost

                                 # true → show "[LP applied: ...]" in worker output
